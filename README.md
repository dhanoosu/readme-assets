# readme-assets
Private repo for uploading README assets via GitHub issues to generate public CDN links

## Purpose:
This private repository serves as a centralized location for uploading and hosting media assets (e.g., GIFs, screenshots) used in README files or documentation across other projects.

## Workflow:
Assets are uploaded via GitHub issue or PR comments to generate public CDN links (`user-images.githubusercontent.com/...`) that can be embedded in Markdown.

## Benefits:
Keeps main project repos uncluttered, simplifies asset management, and ensures consistent hosting for visuals used in Raycast extensions, open-source tools, or documentation.
